Implemented the max_points_in_program constraint (finally). This had
some repercusions for the parsing, as suddenly a configuration file
could in principle be too long. This lead to the solution to configure the
'next' environment instead of the current. So, from now on, when you want
to configure an environment, it works like this:

Env root;
root.configure(parse(configfilecontents));

Env& env = root.next(); // next is now configured.

Removed make_default_env. Uses 'Env::clone' from now on.

Resolved issues with linking against a static push-library. All
instructions will now be linked in by default.

Added pushgp_ramp to re-introduce ramping

Overhauled the execution engine. Much faster now. Exec is now a
true type with a get_stack<Exec> function. It's a weak_ptr with the
guard holding the shared pointer.
